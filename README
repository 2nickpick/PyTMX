===============================================================================

This map loader can be used to load maps created in the Tiled map editor.  It
provides a simple way to get tiles and associated metadata so that you can draw
a map onto the screen.

This is *not* a rendering engine.  It will load the data that is necessary to
render a map onto the screen.  All tiles will be loaded into in memory and
available to blit onto the screen.


Design Goals:
    Simple api for accessing tile metadata and images
    Memory efficient and fast

Features:
    Loads data and "properties" metadata from Tile's TMX format
    "Properties" for: maps, tilesets, layers, objectgroups, objects, and tiles
    Automatic flipping and rotation of tile images
    Supports base64, csv, gzip, zlib and uncompressed TMX
    Image loading with pygame

Missing:
    Polyline (new in Tiled 0.8.0)
    Polygon (new in Tiled 0.8.0)
